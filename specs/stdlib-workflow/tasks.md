# Standard Library implementation task authority

Spec: [spec.md](spec.md) | Plan: [plan.md](plan.md) | Evidence: [evidence.md](evidence.md).

## Implementation tasks

These five records are the sole editable task authority. IDs derive from the
existing component/section/title-slug convention; the original table had titles,
not literal individual IDs. No external dashboard object identity or new task
population is introduced. All five remain Open. The selected
`stdlib/compiler-support` outcome uses these same tasks and retains its finite
reachable-export scope; wider inventory and release acceptance remain separate.

<!-- stdlib-implementation-tasks:start -->
- [ ] `stdlib/remaining-tasks-and-evidence/reconcile-export-inventory-with-actual-callable-implementations` Reconcile export inventory with actual callable implementations

Status: Open

Evidence baseline: [Library source artifact](../../bootstrap/clojure/src/gravity/bootstrap_impl/components/foundation/00499-standard-library-source-artifact.clj)

Closing evidence: Per-export source/implementation/fixture map, with absent exports explicitly open

- [ ] `stdlib/remaining-tasks-and-evidence/complete-pure-core-collections-text-numeric-and-testing-apis` Complete pure core, collections, text, numeric and testing APIs

Status: Open

Evidence baseline: [Library architecture](../../docs/phase-16-standard-library/211-std1-standard-library-architecture.md)

Closing evidence: Compiled examples and type/arity/value rejection through real APIs

<!-- source-effects-test-interpreter:start -->

Apply the [complete source effect and handler criteria](../effects-workflow/plan.md#complete-source-effect-and-handler-criteria) within this existing task. Status remains Open; frozen finite source review does not accept whole L6 or current implementation.

Decision criterion interface/language/effects/interpret-test-fixture: Interpret declared test fixture handlers with typed request/result, explicit effect allowance and stable fixture setup/teardown semantics; retain original handler labels and captures. Reject: Reject handler request/response mismatch, hidden fixture authority, illegal continuation/capture lifetime or unsupported profile behavior. Required outputs: Typed fixture-handler contract, setup/body/teardown result and failure diagnostics, accepted and rejected fixture cases.

L6 actual fixture-interpreter API criterion (Open): Execute identified typed fixture/fake/mock/golden/deterministic-replay interpretation under the active target profile plus explicit harness grants. Preserve original labels, handler identity, request/response/result/resume/capture facts and stable setup/body/teardown behavior, including actual cleanup and expected structured diagnostics. Record the replaced label, fixture capability and identity and absence of live authority; a fake cannot make a forbidden profile legal or hide an unexpected live effect or missing capability. Refuse type/coverage mismatch, hidden authority, illegal lifetime/continuation transfer and unsupported profile behavior; allow a missing-grant test only when its diagnostic is explicitly expected and retained. Return actual fixture values and setup/body/teardown/failure artifacts for the existing Release harness and Effects conformance consumer. No live provider run or test-harness completion is inferred from publishing an API contract.

- [ ] `stdlib/remaining-tasks-and-evidence/complete-resourceconcurrencyionetwork-apis` Complete resource/concurrency/IO/network APIs

Status: Open

Evidence baseline: [Module inventory](../../docs/phase-16-standard-library/README.md)

Closing evidence: Provider-mediated executions, missing-grant rejection and safe resource teardown

<!-- stdlib-canonical-memory-model-allocation-api:start -->

Apply the [complete source memory-model and provider criteria](../legality-workflow/plan.md#complete-source-memory-model-and-provider-criteria) within this existing task. Status remains Open; frozen finite review does not accept the new whole-source or current composition.

Decision criterion interface/language/memory/allocate-provider-storage: Allocate through the explicitly selected family/provider with declared alignment/layout, initialization, failure/blocking, sharing and runtime/profile contract. Reject: Reject missing/incompatible providers, uninitialized safe reads, illegal alignment/layout and hidden allocation or sharing outside declared policy. Required outputs: Allocation/provider/layout/initialization records, failure and sharing fixtures and profile/ownership denial diagnostics.

L18 selected memory-provider allocation API criterion (Open): Execute the actual public memory/resource API through its explicitly selected compatible provider, enforcing declared family/profile/runtime, layout/alignment, initialization, failure/blocking, ownership/lifetime, sharing and capability policy. Return a real usable value/handle with allocator/provider identity and the source-bound records required by consumers. Cover managed/RC/owned/region/arena/stack/static/linear/borrow/pinned/shared/atomic/foreign/device/unified/MMIO/persistent/constant families wherever supported or explicitly reject their unavailable contracts. Supply genuine positive allocation/use and negative missing-provider, wrong-family/layout/alignment, uninitialized read, hidden allocation and invalid sharing cases; an argument-derived allocation record or passed flag is not execution. Runtime owns the actual service and release/transfer; compiler owners derive safety facts and Auth supplies declarations/selection/grants. Preserve that producer/consumer split, ordinary declared-interface development and all actual held provider/native/device/foreign operations.

- [ ] `stdlib/remaining-tasks-and-evidence/complete-schemaqueryworkflowaimetacryptoui-adapters` Complete schema/query/workflow/AI/meta/crypto/UI adapters

Status: Open

Evidence baseline: [Module inventory](../../docs/phase-16-standard-library/README.md)

Closing evidence: APIs consuming corresponding domain/runtime outcomes, with boundary failures exercised

- [ ] `stdlib/remaining-tasks-and-evidence/integrate-platform-modules-and-close-release-manifests` Integrate platform modules and close release manifests

Status: Open

Evidence baseline: [Platform outcome](../../docs/component-roadmaps/platform.md#release-outcome)

Closing evidence: Actual supported platform API fixtures, unsafe audits and compatibility/stability report

## Historical workflow migration record

The original file follows unchanged as historical workflow evidence. Its
checkboxes and earlier task-source statements do not duplicate the current
implementation authority or imply library implementation completion.

# Tasks: Standard Library workflow migration

Spec: [spec.md](spec.md) | Plan: [plan.md](plan.md) | Evidence: [evidence.md](evidence.md).
Migration owner role: documentation migration maintainer.
Input revision: `017b541d678c6acb93eb5e843b1eda5a66babc32`.

## Declared increment

- [x] T001 [US1] Prepare the four owned artifacts with retained-contract links and exact canonical task anchors.
- [x] T002 [US1] Validate local targets/anchors, semantic names, ASCII, existing document/roadmap checks and negative controls; record results in evidence.md.
- [ ] T003 [US2] Independent review accepts the exact artifact tree, mapping and nonclaims; record disposition in evidence.md.
- [ ] T004 [US2] Integrate the reviewed change and record its merge receipt without claiming implementation completion.

## Dependencies and outcomes

T002 uses prepared artifacts; T003 uses validated exact content; T004 follows accepted review. These are documentation-migration tasks only. Implementation tasks remain at the links in plan.md, not copied into this ledger. Current implementation acceptance is unassessed by this package. Existing accepted finite increments retain their original scope and evidence.

## New-name review

All new paths use `stdlib-workflow` and ordinary artifact names. No planning-ID implementation name or compatibility identifier is changed.
